# 🔐 Cybersecurity Password Safety Infographics

**Commonwealth Bank Cybersecurity Job Simulation – Forage | April 2024**

---

## 📌 Overview

As part of the **Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Cybersecurity Job Simulation** on Forage, I developed cybersecurity awareness infographics to educate employees on best practices for password safety. This initiative supports broader organizational goals related to fraud prevention, user behavior risk reduction, and compliance with national security standards.

The infographics are grounded in guidance from the **Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)** and were designed for non-technical audiences to easily understand and apply strong password hygiene principles.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Raise employee awareness of password-related risks such as credential theft, phishing, and brute-force attacks  
- Translate **ACSC** security recommendations into an easy-to-digest, visual format  
- Support a security-first culture through accessible internal training resources

## 🛠 Tools & Resources

- 🎨 **Canva** – Used to create the infographics with a focus on accessibility and clarity  
- 📚 **ACSC Best Practices** – Research source for secure password creation and management  
- 🧾 **PDF Format** – Final deliverable designed for easy internal distribution

## 🛡️ Why It Matters

This project demonstrates the ability to bridge the gap between technical standards and user behavior—a key competency in **GRC**, **InfoSec training**, and **security culture development** roles. It reflects practical experience with educating employees, developing policy-aligned assets, and reinforcing the “human layer” of cybersecurity.
